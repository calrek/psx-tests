=========

Welcome to the testarea of the PSX framework. This is the testing website wich 
is used by the unit tests in the PSX framwork to test more complex cases. In 
order to help other projects with testing and to create more server and client 
interoperability you can also use these testing endpoints. Every test module has 
a description how you can use it for testing. Each test makes heavy use of HTTP 
status codes. If the test returns an "2xx" status code the request was 
successful. All errors wich are thrown by a test have detailed informations 
about what went wrong. If a testcase doest not behave correctly do not hesitate 
to contact me.
