psx-tests
=========

Welcome to the testarea of the PSX framework. This is the testing website wich 
is used by the unit tests in the PSX framwork to test more complex cases. In 
order to help other projects with testing and to create more interoperability 
between client and server implementations you can freely use these testing 
endpoints. Every test module has a description how you can use it. The tests 
makes heavy use of HTTP status codes. If the test returns "2xx" status code the 
request was successful. All errors wich are thrown by a test have detailed 
informations about what went wrong. If a testcase doest not behave correctly do 
not hesitate to contact me.
